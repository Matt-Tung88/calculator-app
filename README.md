# Calculator React Application

## About
* A web application that outputs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app
* Results remain in session
* Only show the last 10 calculations descending from most recent to oldest

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript/React

## Possible Improvements
* Creating a login page that then directs the user to the application page instead of a name input field/single-page application
* Store “Calculations” in a database rather than just memory due to server volatility
* Use React Reducer instead of useState for the “Calculations” portion; utilize more efficient React Hooks and tools
* Add more functions such as log, sqrt, etc.

## How to Use
1. Clone and run locally!

2. Enter your name and compute a calculation. After pressing “=”, the calculation will appear on the right under “Calculations”.
